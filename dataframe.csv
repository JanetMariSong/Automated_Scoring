- “The graph of k is concave up at x=4 because the graph of kʺ(x) is negative…”  
  - Criteria (b)–3 (Conclusion with correct sign reasoning): 0/1  
    (A negative second derivative means concave down, so the statement is incorrect.)

701,2023,BC,2,b,C,"- 2 sin t = 1.5  
  - Criteria (correct speed equation): not earned. The response does not show or use √((e^(cos t))² + (2 cos t)²) = 1.5.

  - Criteria (correct limit‐of‐integration setup): 1/1

- 2nd Expression:  
  “Antiderivative = 144 ln|x² + 6x + 9| + C.”  
  - Criteria (correct antiderivative): 0/1  
    - Justification: The correct antiderivative of 144/(x+3)² is −144/(x+3).  Using 144 ln|x² + 6x + 9| is incorrect.

- 3rd Expression:  
  “Conclusion: The integral diverges.”  
  - Criteria (final answer of 48): 0/1  
    - Justification: The correct value of the integral is 48.  Claiming divergence forfeits this point.

  • Criteria (derivative‐based justification for sign of h′(–0.5)): 0/1  
    – No mention of h′(–0.5) or f′(–0.5)−g′(–0.5); reason given (comparing areas) does not address the derivative.  
  • Criteria (correct conclusion tied to h′(–0.5)<0): 0/1  
    – Although the student says “Decreasing,” the rubric requires a derivative‐based (or slope‐based) argument at x=–0.5; comparing areas does not satisfy that requirement.

  - Criteria (Establish that −6 is between r′(0) and r′(3)): 0/1 (They do not state that −6 is between −6.1 and −5.0.)

  • Product‐rule point: 0 / 1 (the expression incorrectly multiplies both derivatives in a single term rather than adding separate terms for d(r²)/dt and dh/dt)  
  • Chain‐rule point: 0 / 1 (the chain rule was not applied correctly; r(t) and h(t) must be differentiated separately)

- “dV/dt = −(20000/3) π”

- “(1 / [½ sin((π/2)x)]) … = √(y+7)²”  
  • Antiderivative points (2 pts total): 0/2

  - Criteria (Correct derivative a₍Q₎(t) = −2/t³?) : 0/1 points

  - Criteria (Correct sign analysis of v₍Q₎ and a₍Q₎?) : 0/1 points

- 3rd Statement: “for all t > 0, a₍Q₎(t) = positive”  
  - Criteria (Conclusion that speed is decreasing with justification?) : 0/1 points  
    • The conclusion contradicts the correct scenario (where speed is decreasing).

71,2022,AB,6,d,C,"- 1st Sentence/Expression (“Vp(t) … 4e^(−∞)… VQ(t) … 1/∞² … P will eventually be farther…speed is infinitely growing…”)
  - Criteria (correct limits for P or Q): 0/1  
    (No correct limit is given for the positions xₚ(t) or yQ(t). Statements refer only to velocities and are incorrect about “infinite growth.”)
  - Criteria (correct conclusion with valid reason): 0/1  
    (Although the conclusion “P is farther” is stated, the reason is invalid: it relies on speeds rather than correctly comparing the limiting positions 6 vs. 3.)

89,2023,AB,2,b,C,"- ""v′(t) = −0.467""  
  - Criterion (derivative‐as‐acceleration setup and correct value): 0/1  
    (No explicit statement that v′(60) = a(60), and the numeric value does not match the required −0.036.)

  - Criterion (acceleration with correct units): 0/1  
    (No explicit mention of acceleration units “m/s².”)  
  - Criterion (correct conclusion about speeding/slowing with consistent signs): 0/1  
    (The official model shows v(60) < 0 and a(60) < 0 ⇒ speeding up. The student’s stated signs contradict the model’s values.)

  - Criteria (Use of L’Hospital’s Rule) : not earned / 1

- Final conclusion/answer:  (Stated or implied limit = 0)

- h′(7) = f′(g(7)) + g′(7) = 3/2 + 8 = 19/2

120,2023,AB,6,a,C,"- 1st Mathematical expression: ""6x dy y dx/dy = 3y² dy/dx""  
  - Criteria (Implicit differentiation of 6xy = 2 + y³): 0/1 (the expression omits the separate derivative of 6xy as 6y + 6x (dy/dx), and does not match the correct form 6y + 6x (dy/dx) = 3y² (dy/dx))  

- 2nd Mathematical expression: ""dy/dv = 2y/(y² - 2x)""  
  - Criteria (Solving for dy/dx correctly): 0/1 (the correct final form is indeed 2y/(y² - 2x), but the first point was not satisfied, so per rubric notes the second point cannot be earned)

131,2023,AB,3,c,C,"- The student’s expression and work for the second derivative  
  – Criteria (correct expression for d²M/dt²): 0/1 points  
    - The response gives d²M/dt² = (40−M)/16 rather than −(40−M)/16 and thus is missing the negative sign. This does not match the required −(1/16)(40−M) in terms of M, so the first point is not earned.  

- The student’s conclusion about over/underestimation  
  – Criteria (overestimate with correct concavity reasoning): 0/1 points  
    - Although the final statement says the tangent‐line approximation is an overestimate, the reasoning given (that (40−M)/16 is “positive” implies concave down) is contradictory.  A correct justification requires noting d²M/dt² < 0 or that M is concave down for M < 40.  Because the sign is handled incorrectly, the second point is not earned.  

- total points : 0 out of 2",0,0,7
137,2023,AB,4,a,C,"- 1st Sentence: “Neither. Since f′(6)=0, f does have on extrema at x=6, but since f″(6)=0, as well, f(6) must be an inflection point.”  
  - Criterion (the required reason is that f ′ does not change sign at x=6) : 0/1  
    - The response never addresses the sign of f ′ on either side of x=6 and instead relies on f″(6)=0.  The rubric requires mentioning that f ′ does not change sign at x=6 as the reason there is neither a max nor a min.  Hence this does not earn the point.

- “0 < t < 2.101022”

  - Criteria (Earns first point by showing derivative = (H−1)cos(t/2) = 0 ⇒ cos(t/2) = 0 when H(t) > 1): 0/1  
    Justification: The work does not explicitly set cos(t/2) = 0 or discuss that (H−1) ≠ 0 because H(t) > 1.  

- Second Mathematical/Explanatory Statement: ""t = 3/2 is the critical point""  
  - Criteria (Earns second point by identifying t = π as the critical point): 0/1  
    Justification: The correct critical point in 0 < t < 5 is t = π ≈ 3.14, not 3/2 = 1.5.  

- Third Mathematical/Explanatory Statement: ""3/2 is a relative minimum""  
  - Criteria (Earns third point by concluding a relative maximum at t = π with correct sign/second derivative argument): 0/1  
    Justification: The solution needed to show that H increases on (0,π) and decreases on (π,5), leading to a relative maximum at t = π. Instead, it concludes a relative minimum at t = 3/2, which is incorrect.

  Justification:  
  Although the student correctly concludes “neither,” the required reasoning is that f′ does not change sign at x=6.

Detailed justification:

• The rubric awards the single point in part (a) only when the response correctly identifies that f′(x) does not change sign at x=6 and concludes “neither” a maximum nor a minimum for that reason.  
• This response does say “neither,” but it relies on f′(6)=0 and claims f(6) must be an inflection point.  The second‐derivative argument is neither required nor fully justified by the given derivative graph, and it does not show that f′(x) fails to change sign.  
• Because the response does not use (or imply) the “no sign change in f′” reasoning, it does not meet the rubric criterion and does not earn the point.",0,0,4

1 point for recognizing that (since H(t) > 1) setting dH/dt = 0 forces cos(t/2) = 0,

    – Earned 0/1 points.  
    – Explanation:  The work does not use H(t) > 1 to deduce that the factor (H − 1) ≠ 0 and so dH/dt = 0 requires cos(t/2) = 0.

Under the rubric (“If the acceleration vector is not presented as an ordered pair, the x‐ and y‐components must be labeled”), the acceleration vector is deemed unsupported and thus only one of the last two points would be possible.
